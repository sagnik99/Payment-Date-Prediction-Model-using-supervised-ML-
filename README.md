# Payment-Date-Prediction-Model-using-supervised-ML-

The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other
businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller
business issues an invoice for the same. This invoice for the goods contains various information
like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. This is known in accounting
terminology as “Accounts Receivable”.
The objective of this project is:
● Data Preprocessing of invoices dataset
● Feature Engineering on the dataset
● To build a Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it
gets created in the system
